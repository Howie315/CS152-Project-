## Phase 0

#### Language Name
 HRG-Lang

#### Extension
 *.hrg

#### Compiler
HRG-LC

### Basic Features

| Feature | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Integer scalar variables | int x; float y; double z; bool w; char i; |
| One-dimensional arrays of integers | int array[x]; float array[x]; double array[x]; bool array[x]; char string[x]; (x being a fixed number)|
| Assignment statements | int array [] = {1, 0, 1}; , int number = 0; etc.. |
| Arithmetic operators | “+”, “-”, “\*”, “/” |
| Relational operators |  “<”, “==”, “>”, “~=” |
| While loop (including "break" and "continue" loop control statements) | while (is_open){ "do something" continue; if is_open = false: break;} |
| If-then-else statements | if( CONDITION ) { BODY }, else{ BODY } | 
| Read and write statements | INPUT = intake(); defecate(OUTPUT); |
| Comments |"$ This is a comment. $" |
|  Functions (that can take multiple scalar arguments and return a single scalar result) | int func{ return int;} double func { return double;} char func { return char; }  void func{ }|

### More Information
1. Define how comments would look like in your language
* Defined above already. Single line comments start and end with $
* Multi-line comments start with and end with $$

2. Define what would be the valid identifier
* Names can ONLY contain letters and underscores
* Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
* Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)
* Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names

3. Whether your language is case sensitive or not
* Language will be case sensitive to allow for greater range of character usage.

4. What would be whitespces in your laguage
* Whitespace will be ignorable in our language and only for the purpose of readability for the programmer.
* Semi-colons will be used to determine statements and not whitespace.
