# Phase 0

1. Create a name for the experimental programming language
* HRG

2. Decide the extension given to the programs written in the defined language
* hello.hrg

3. Create a name for the compiler (e.g., XYZ-LC)
* HRG-LC

## The experimental language should at least cover the following basic features:

1. Integer scalar variables
* int x; float y; double z; bool w;

2. One-dimensional arrays of integers
* int array[]

3. Assignment statements
* int array [] = {1, 0, 1}; , int number = 0; etc..

4. Arithmetic operators (e.g., “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”)
* “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”

5. Relational operators (e.g., “<”, “==”, “>”, “!=”)
* “<”, “==”, “>”, “~=”

6. While loop (including "break" and "continue" loop control statements)
*  while (is_open){ "do something" continue; if is_open = false: break;}

7. If-then-else statements
* if( CONDITION ) { BODY }, else{ BODY }

8. Read and write statements
* INPUT = intake(), defecate(OUTPUT)

9. Comments
* "$ This is a comment. $"

* "$$ This is a multi
    line comment $$"

10. Functions (that can take multiple scalar arguments and return a single scalar result)
*
