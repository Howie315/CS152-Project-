#Phase 0
First, your team needs to
● Create a name for the experimental programming language (e.g., XYZ-L)
● Decide the extension given to the programs written in the defined language, (e.g., hello.xyz)
● Create a name for the compiler (e.g., XYZ-LC)
The experimental language should at least cover the following basic features:
● Integer scalar variables
● One-dimensional arrays of integers
● Assignment statements
● Arithmetic operators (e.g., “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”)
● Relational operators (e.g., “<”, “==”, “>”, “!=”)
● While loop (including "break" and "continue" loop control statements)
● If-then-else statements
● Read and write statements
● Comments
● Functions (that can take multiple scalar arguments and return a single scalar result)
